# go-torrent
This is a simple Bit Torrent client written in Go :)

To use it, first you need to build a executable:
`go build .`

An then you can run 
`./go-torrent some_torrent_file destination_of_downloaded_torrent` 

As of now this client does not support magnet links and a bunch of other stuff but hey, it's something I guess
